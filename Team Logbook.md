First team meeting. Discussed possible project concepts.
Andrew proposed a client he had previous contact with about creating a chatbot.
Michelangelo proposed a diagnostic tool for eye exams. Thomas has a possible client for this project.
The team did not reach a consensus and decided to brainstorm and ponder about the proposals some more.
